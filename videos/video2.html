        <p class="project-description">This is an extract from the talk I gave at the <strong>Finnish Internet Forum</strong>. The event was organized by the Finnish Parliament, to discuss issues such as the future of the Internet and of technology entrepreneurship. I discussed the challenges of cloud computing and privacy laws (due to my experience with MySites), and my experience co-founding a program called Summer of Startups.</p>

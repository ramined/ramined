        <p class="project-description">I was in charge of our presence at Assembly, the largest gaming event in Northern Europe, with 5000 gamers attending over the weekend. We decided to turn the stadium into a giant screen, where each monitor would be treated as a unique pixel. We made a "demoscene" style video, in the visual style of Gameboy demos (there were roughly 70x70 screens) in a week.</p>
